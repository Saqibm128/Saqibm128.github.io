This week, I basically did not have a chance to get much any work done. I'm planning on doing work this weekend, but until today, I really have lost much of a chance to get anything done. This blogpost is more of a rant to channel some of my negative emotions.

At the beginning of last week, during the lst few days of Ramadan, I broke my hand in a bike fall. I seriously busted up my lips and sandpapered the inside of my lips when I fell face-first into hard gravelly sidewalk. I didn't have a concussion, thanks to a helmet, but had to limit what I ate for a few days due to the open sores on the inside of my cheeks.

Last weekend was Eid, when I went to Atlanta to celebrate with family. I was unable to do much, unfortunately, as my hand was broken. My parents let me borrow a car for a ten hour drive up to DC. I parked my car in my apartment parking lot at night, with plans to register it later in the morning. However, the car was towed and I had to spend 3 or so hours trying to track it down and figure out how to pay for it and prove my parents owned it.

That day, I also had a primary doctor appointment followup to confirm that I was doing the right steps to recovery. It was telehealth, but I ended up waiting another 45 minutes from my scheduled time to hear back from the doctor.

Tuesday, I went to the dentist for an emergency visit, because I thought my bite had changed, and my sister was saying my jaw looked different. As this visit was unplanned, I ended up waiting an extra hour and half to see the dentist. Turned out I was alright.

I spent another three hours on Tuesday on a planning meeting for a planning meeting. (I think I put my foot down when I said no more planning meetings.)

Wednesday, I went to an orthopedics specialist. He suggested I wear a cast until I got an ulnar gutter split. I told him I already had one, but he didn't seem to listen. I took off the cast a few hours later when I realized I couldn't take off a jacket I had over it and used the splint I already had.

Thursday, I had a wisdom teeth surgery. It was alright, but I took much of the day off regardless. I got sent home with a lot of pills to handle potential pain and other issues. I'm trying to remember it all, to eat with a broken hand and a mouth that's kinda broken again too.


I'm also suffering from some kinda allergies/cold. I don't know, this week has been stupid overall and I feel rather miserable and angry.

But I am keeping my body healthy and doing stuff that in the longterm will help me.

And so be it.
